java-allocation-instrumenter
============================

Fork of https://code.google.com/p/java-allocation-instrumenter/ which is where all the main development still happens. The main developers are using SVN and Google Code, which makes it incredibly hard to contribute... but not quite as bad as the bad old sourceforge days. I've also introduced some API changes and dropped the Guava dependency.
